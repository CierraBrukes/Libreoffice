# Libreoffice

ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ **LibreOffice is Open Source Software. Development is open to new talent and new ideas, and our software is tested and used daily by a large and devoted user community**

*The Document Foundation*

+  It is an independent self-governing meritocratic entity, created by a large group of Free Software advocates, in the form of a charitable Foundation under German law

+  It continues to build on the foundation of the dedicated work by the OpenOffice.org Community

+  It was created in the belief that the culture born of an independent Foundation brings out the best in contributors and will deliver the best software for users

+  It is open to any individual who agrees with our core values and contributes to our activities

+  It welcomes corporate participation, e.g. by sponsoring individuals to work as equals alongside other contributors in the community

+  The Document Foundation is proud to be the home of LibreOffice, the next evolution of the worldâ€™s leading free office suite, and The Document Liberation Project, a community of developers united to free users from vendor lock-in of content by providing powerful tools for the conversion of proprietary file formats to the corresponding ODF format

*LibreOffice 24.2 Community also includes many other changes, including improvements in accessibility, change tracking, spell checking, and interoperability with Microsoftâ€™s proprietary file formats. Notably, Impress now allows small caps in text and secured slide show remote control with bluetooth, as well as enhancements to supplied templates*
